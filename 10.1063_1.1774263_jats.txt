Growth of CoSi2 on Si(001) by reactive deposition epitaxy
CaF2-structure CoSi2 layers were formed on Si(001) by reactive deposition epitaxy (RDE) and compared with CoSi2 layers obtained by conventional solid phase growth (SPG). In both sets of experiments, Co was deposited by ultrahigh-vacuum magnetron sputtering and CoSi2 formed at 600°C. However, in the case of RDE, CoSi2 formation occurred during Co deposition while for SPG, Co was deposited at 25°C and silicidation took place during subsequent annealing. X-ray diffraction pole figures and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that RDE CoSi2 layers are epitaxial with a cube-on-cube relationship, (001)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [100]CoSi2‖[100]Si. In contrast, SPG films are polycrystalline with an average grain size of ≃1000Å and a mixed 111∕002∕022∕112 orientation. We attribute the striking difference to rapid Co diffusion into the Si(001) substrate during RDE for which the high Co∕Si reactivity gives rise to a flux-limited reaction resulting in the direct formation of the disilicide phase. In contrast, sequential nucleation and transformation among increasingly Si-rich phases—from orthorhombic Co2Si to cubic CoSi to CoSi2—during SPG results in polycrystalline layers with a complex texture.
INTRODUCTION
As Si-based microelectronic device scaling extends into the deep submicron regime, the parasitic electrical resistance of gate electrodes and source∕drain regions will continue to increase. Metal silicides have become the primary contact and interconnect materials utilized in high-speed complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices in order to reduce the propagation delay and increase the drive current. CoSi2 has been widely accepted as a replacement for TiSi2 for sub-0.25‐μm technology due to its high electrical conductivity, low thermal budget, superior plasma etch resistance, and ease of implementation in narrow gate electrode structures. In addition, process compatibility and the inertness of CoSi2 toward dopants allow it to be incorporated in the silicide-as-diffusion-source process and used in advanced raised source∕drain devices. Despite the increased stress generated by epitaxial CoSi2(001), due to differences in film∕substrate lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficients, the need for epitaxial CoSi2, rather than its polycrystalline counterpart, has become apparent for future generation ultrashallow junction devices in order to minimize drain-induced barrier lowering and junction punch-through. The relatively small lattice constant mismatch (≃1.23%) between CoSi2 and Si and the similarity in crystal structure (CoSi2 is Cl‐CaF2 while Si is diamond cubic) allow the possibility of growing epitaxial CoSi2 layers on Si(001).
The formation of epitaxial CoSi2 on Si(111) has been demonstrated by solid phase growth (SPG) in which Co is deposited at room temperature and silicidation occurs during subsequent annealing, typically carried out at temperatures Ta=500–800°C. However, attempts to form epitaxial CoSi2 on Si(001) by SPG have resulted in polycrystalline layers. Lawrence et al. demonstrated that the use of a thin (≃200Å) sputter-deposited Ti buffer layer to mediate the aggressive Co∕Si interfacial reaction allows the formation of epitaxial CoSi2(001) layers with (111) facets along the silicide∕Si interface. Subsequently, most research on the formation of epitaxial CoSi2 on Si(001) has been focused on the quest for improved buffer layers including the use of SiO2, Ta, Hf, Nb, and Fe. A variety of techniques including e-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, sputtering, and organometallic chemical-vapor deposition have been used to deposit the Co films. However, the growth of phase-pure single-crystal CoSi2 films directly on Si(001), without the use of buffer layers, remains a challenge due to the competitive formation of several CoSix phases and CoSi2 variants.
In this paper, we report the growth of ≃400Å thick epitaxial CoSi2 layers on Si(001), with no buffer layers, by reactive deposition epitaxy (RDE) in which Co is deposited at 600°C by ultrahigh-vacuum magnetron sputtering. The heated Si(001) substrate provides an efficient sink, due to rapid in-diffusion, for incident Co atoms, thus creating a Co-flux-limited process allowing the direct formation of the Si-rich CoSi2 phase while inhibiting formation of the competing Co-rich phases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show that the layers consist of phase-pure epitaxial CoSi2(001) containing fourfold symmetric {111} twins.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
All growth experiments were carried out in a load-locked multichamber ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) stainless-steel magnetron sputter deposition system, described in detail in Ref. , with a base pressure of 5×10−10Torr (7×10−8Pa). The target, a 99.97% pure Co disk, was sputtered in pure Ar (99.9999%) discharges maintained at 20mTorr (2.67Pa) using a capacitance manometer and an automatic mass-flow controller. The target power was 20W resulting in a Co deposition rate of ≃1Ås−1.
The substrates were B-doped Si(001) wafers with resistivities of 0.5–1.0Ωcm (p=1−3×1016cm−8). The initial cleaning consisted of degreasing by successive rinses in trichloroethane, acetone, propanol, and deionized water. The substrates were then subjected to four wet-chemical oxidation∕etch cycles involving the following sequence of steps: 2min in a 2:1:1 solution of H2O:HCl:H2O2, rinse in fresh deionized water, and a 30s etch in dilute (10%) HF. They were blown dry in ultrahigh-purity N2 and exposed to a UV∕ozone treatment to remove C-contaning species. An additional 30s etch in dilute HF was then used to remove the native SiO2 layer and form a H-terminated Si(001) surface prior to loading the substrate into a separately pumped sample introduction chamber for transport to the deposition chamber. Final substrate cleaning consisted of thermal degassing at 600°C for 30min. The Co target was sputter etched for 5min, with a shutter shielding the substrate, prior to initiating deposition.
Co deposition during RDE was carried out at a temperature Ts=600°C, including the contribution due to plasma heating. The Si(001) substrates were heated resistively and Ts was measured using a pyrometer calibrated by thermocouples bonded to sacrificial Si(001) wafers. RDE layer thicknesses ranged from 300to550Å. For the SPG experiments, 100Å thick Co layers were deposited on Si(001) at Ts=25°C and ≃350Å thick CoSi2 films were formed during subsequent postdeposition annealing at 600°C for 10min.
Film microstructure and texture were investigated using a combination of XRD, TEM, and cross-sectional TEM (XTEM). The XRD measurements were carried out in a powder diffractometer system with a CuKα source (λ=1.5406Å) and an incident slit divergence of 1° for ω‐2θ scans. Layer textures were determined from pole-figure measurements using a four-circle Philips X-pert MRD diffractometer operated at 45kV and 40mA with a 1×6mm2 point-focus Cu x-ray source and secondary optics equipped with a parallel plate collimator, a flat graphite crystal monochromator, and a proportional detector. For epitaxial CoSi2 layers, lattice parameters a⊥ along the growth direction, in-plane lattice parameters a‖, and residual strains were obtained from high-resolution reciprocal lattice maps (HR-RLMs) around 224 asymmetric reflections. A series of ω‐2θ scans was acquired at different ω offsets.
TEM and XTEM analyses were performed in a Philips CM12 microscope with a 120kV LaB6 filament and a JEOL 2010F instrument equipped with a field-emission gun operating at 200kV. Plan-view samples were mechanically ground from the backside with SiC to a thickness of ≃25μm. Final thinning to electron transparency was accomplished by ion milling using a 4kV Ar+-ion beam incident at 8°. Cross-sectional samples were prepared by gluing two samples film-to-film and then cutting vertical sections which were ground and milled in a manner similar to that of the plan-view samples, but from both sides.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Microstructure of RDE and SPG CoSi2 layers
XRD ω‐2θ scans obtained from RDE CoSi2 layers over the range from 25° to 100° exhibit only 002 and 004 peaks, while peaks arising from multiple grain orientations, primarily 111 and 022, are observed for SPG layers. Typical results are plotted in Fig.with the scans offset vertically to avoid overlap. The forbidden Si 002 peak, which occurs due to multiple diffraction, is located at 32.97° (aSi=5.431Å) while the 002 and 004 reflections from the 400Å thick RDE film corresponding to Fig. (a) are at 33.86° and 71.06° (see the inset), yielding a lattice parameter a⊥ along the film growth direction of 5.302Å. The reported positions of the corresponding peaks for bulk powder CoSi2 samples are 33.40° and 70.12° (aCoSi2=5.364Å) indicating that the RDE CoSi2 films are in tension. In contrast, only a small 002 peak is observed in SPG film scans [see Fig. (b) corresponding to a 350Å thick SPG layer], while 111 and 022 peaks are detected at 28.88° and 48.19°, very close to the relaxed CoSi2 peak positions of 28.81° and 47.92°.
Figureis a typical HR-RLM about the asymmetric 224 reflection of a RDE CoSi2(001) layer. Diffracted intensity distributions are plotted as isointensity contours as a function of the reciprocal lattice vectors aligned parallel k‖ and perpendicular k⊥ to the surface. The CoSi2 lattice parameters determined from Fig.are a‖=5.411Å in plane with a⊥=5.315Å along the film growth direction. This corresponds to an in-plane tensile strain ε‖ of −0.37% which can be explained by differential thermal contraction [the thermal expansion coefficients for CoSi2 and Si are 9.4×10−6 and 2.9×10−6 K−1 (Ref. )] during cooling from the deposition temperature, 600°C.
The relaxed RDE CoSi2(001) lattice constant, determined from measured a‖ and a⊥ values through the relationship　where ν=0.33 is the Poisson ratio, is 5.363Å. This is essentially identical to the value (5.364Å) obtained from bulk powder samples. The layer relaxation R is given by the relationship　where aSi and aCoSi2 are the bulk Si and CoSi2 lattice parameters. For the RDE film corresponding to Fig. , R=29%. The full widths at half maximum intensity Γ of the CoSi2 224 peak along 2θ and ω directions are Γ2θ=0.86° and Γω=0.50°.
In-plane and perpendicular x-ray coherence lengths ξ‖ and ξ⊥ can be estimated from the widths of the diffracted intensity distributions perpendicular, Δg⊥, and parallel, Δg‖, respectively, to the diffraction vector g¯ using the following relationships which, while strictly valid for the case in which there is no crystallite misorientation or inhomogeneous strain, are commonly used to provide a measure of epitaxial quality:　and　λ is the x-ray wavelength. From the data presented in Fig.with g¯=224, ξ‖ and ξ⊥ are 124 and 145Å for 400Å thick RDE CoSi2(001) layers and limited, as shown by XTEM results presented below, by the presence of {111} twins.
Figureis a typical bright-field XTEM image, obtained along the ⟨110⟩ zone axis, from a RDE CoSi2 layer. The micrograph reveals the presence of {111} planar defects. A selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and a corresponding simulated pattern, in which all reflections are labeled, are shown in Figs. , respectively. The SAED pattern consists of overlapping symmetric single-crystal diffraction spots emanating from the {002}, {111}, and {220} planes of the RDE CoSi2 layer (◆) and the Si(001) substrate (엯). The reflections labeled as solid circles (●) are at positions corresponding to {111} twins in CoSi2 [the planar defects shown in Fig. ] which give rise to double-diffraction features labeled ⊗. The reflections located at positions ng¯111∕3, where n is an integer, in the SAED pattern are the mirror images of epitaxial CoSi2 diffraction spots (◆) about {111} twin planes. For example, Fig.shows that the 11¯1¯t and 002t twin diffraction spots are the mirror images of primary 11¯1¯ and 002 reflections across the (11¯1) twin plane.
Figureis a [001] plan-view bright-field TEM micrograph, obtained using two-beam imaging conditions with g¯=400, from the same RDE CoSi2 layer shown in Fig . The image consists of two distinct domains: dark, mottled regions labeled E and bright regions labeled T. The fringes observed in the epitaxial regions (E) arise from the extinction contours as a result of specimen bending. The bright regions (T), corresponding to the planar defects in Fig. , consist of {111} twins. These regions are tilted away from the Bragg condition with g¯=400, therefore they appear in bright contrast with no bend contours. Experimental and simulated SAED patterns from this sample are reproduced in Figs. . The observed {220} and {040} reflections are common to both the CoSi2(001) layer and the Si(001) substrate while the {020} reflections, which are forbidden for the Si diamond-cubic structure, emanate only from the epitaxial overlayer. The combination of the plan-view and cross-sectional SAED patterns show that the RDE CoSi2 layer grows epitaxially on Si(001) with a cube-on-cube epitaxial orientation, (001)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [100]CoSi2‖[100]Si.
Typical bright-field plan-view TEM and XTEM micrographs from a SPG CoSi2 layer are presented in Fig. . TEM images reveal that SPG films, in contrast to the RDE CoSi2(001) layers which are epitaxial, are polycrystalline in agreement with the XRD results. The bright-field [001] plan-view TEM micrograph in Fig.shows that the SPG layer is dense and consists of grains which are approximately equiaxed. The average grain size of SPG films, obtained from plan-view TEM images [including Fig. ] corresponding to a total area of more than 3μm2, is 1000±500Å. Figureis a plan-view SAED pattern composed of 111, 002, 022, and 113 diffraction rings arising from {002}-, {111}-, {112}-, and {022}-oriented CoSi2 grains. The rings are discontinuous due to the large grain size. The [110] XTEM image in Fig.shows that the SPG CoSi2 layer thickness is nonuniform, ranging from 320to415Å, giving rise to a very rough surface.
The difference in microstructures of SPG vs RDE CoSi2—polycrystalline vs epitaxial—can be understood by considering the nature of the reaction path leading to film formation in the two processes. During SPG solid phase reaction, the high Co flux results in the initial formation of a metal-rich silicide. The sequential nucleation and transformation among increasingly Si-rich phases during annealing, from Co2SitoCoSi and to CoSi2, gives rise to disilicide layers with polycrystalline texture. In contrast, the heated Si(001) substrate provides an efficient sink, due to rapid in-diffusion, for incident Co atoms, thus creating a Co-flux-limited process and allowing the direct formation of the Si-rich CoSi2 phase while inhibiting formation of the competing Co-rich phases. Therefore, the formation of the metal-rich Co2Si and CoSi monosilicide phases is avoided during RDE growth, and the small lattice mismatch between CoSi2 and Si combined with the similarity in film∕substrate crystal structures results in epitaxial growth directly.
High-resolution TEM and XRD studies of RDE CoSi2(001) microstructure
We use high-resolution XTEM (HR-XTEM) to characterize the planar defects [see Fig. ] in RDE CoSi2 layers. Figureis a typical HR-XTEM micrograph obtained along the [110] zone axis of an epitaxial RDE CoSi2 layer with a (11¯1) twin. The lattice fringes are continuous throughout the entire layer thickness and exhibit a 180° rotation about the (11¯1) plane, oriented at 54.73° from (001), to form a mirror image across the twin. A CoSi2 atomic structure model, corresponding to Fig.and based upon the orientation relationships determined from HR-XTEM and SAED patterns, is shown in Fig. . All lattice positions in the twinned region are displaced in the shear direction [1¯12] by an amount proportional to their distance from the (11¯1) twin plane. The {001} planes exhibit a 70.53° rotation about the [110] pole. Consequently, the (22¯1) plane is perpendicular to the film growth direction, yielding the following epitaxial relationship between CoSi2 twinned regions and the substrate: (22¯1)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [110]CoSi2‖[110]Si. Bulle-Liewma et al. reported a similar orientation relationship between {221}-oriented grains and the substrate in polycrystalline CoSi2 layers, with a dominant 110 texture, formed on Si(001) at 900°C using solid phase growth.
A typical bright-field XTEM image of RDE CoSi2(001) layer is shown in Fig. . The film∕substrate interface is primarily planar along (001), but contains {111} interfacial facets, as indicated with arrows, located at 54.73° to the (001) plane. Based upon multiple images, corresponding to more than 5μm of interface, obtained from several samples, the average facet size measured along (111) planes is ≈12nm and the average facet separation is 56nm. Figureis a HR-XTEM micrograph of the interfacial region in the RDE sample corresponding to the area highlighted in Fig. . The image was obtained with the electron beam along the CoSi2 [110] direction. The upper-left side of the micrograph is an untwinned epitaxial RDE CoSi2 region bounded by (001) and (11¯1) Si planes indicated by dotted and dashed lines, respectively. The general orientation relationship for the {111} interfacial facets as determined from HR-XTEM images is {111}CoSi2‖{111}Si and ⟨110⟩CoSi2‖⟨110⟩Si. We attribute the formation of these facetted interface segments to the lower energy of the (111) compared to the (001) surface of CoSi2. Calculated (001) and (111) CoSi2 surfaces energies, based on density functional methods employing the generalized gradient approximation, are 258meVÅ−2 and 136meVÅ−2, respectively.
XRD pole-figure measurements were carried out to determine the in-plane orientation of the twinned regions in CoSi2(001). The left side of Fig.shows two quadrants of a typical 224 XRD pole figure from a RDE CoSi2(001) layer; the right side is a simulated pattern with all reflections labeled. The detector angle 2θ was set at 89.479° and the tilt angle ψ was varied from 0° to 86° in 2° steps while the azimuthal angle ϕ was continuously scanned at every ψ value and integrated over 2° intervals with 5s acquisition periods for each data point. The epitaxial relationship between the CoSi2 layer and the Si(001) substrate gives rise to the following reflections (labeled O) in Fig. : the four peaks located at ψ=35.3° and separated by ϕ=90° emanate from (224), (2¯24), (22¯4), and (22¯4) CoSi2 planes while the eight peaks at ψ=65.9° and separated by ϕ=37.9° and 52.1° originate from four sets of (h1k12) and (h2k22) planes, where h1=k2=±4 and h2=k1=±2.
The {111} twins in RDE CoSi2 layers generate an additional set of 224 peaks, labeled as diamonds and squares (◇,◆,◻,∎) in Fig. , at ψ=17.7°, 35.3°, 47.1°, 65.9°, 74.2°, and 82.2° corresponding to the six tilt angles between the 221 and 224 families of planes. This observation is in good agreement with HR-XTEM results showing that the 221 planes of {111}-twinned regions are orthogonal to the growth direction, i.e., {221}CoSi2‖(001)Si. The formation of {111} twins yields four sets (there are four {111} planes in the CoSi2 unit cell) of symmetric 90°-rotated reflections. The peaks due to twins associated with the (111) plane are labeled as ◇: they consist of twelve 224 reflections at ψ=17.7° and ϕ=64.1°,206.0°; ψ=35.3° and ϕ=135.0°; ψ=47.1° and ϕ=292.1°,337.9°; ψ=65.9° and ϕ=63.9°,206.0°; ψ=74.2° and ϕ=97.9°,172.0°,313.9°; ψ=82.2° and ϕ=16.0°,253.9°. The remaining 224 twin reflections associated with the (11¯1), (1¯1¯1), and (1¯11) planes, are labeled as ◆, ◻, and ∎, respectively.
Based on a combination of the TEM and pole-figure analyses, we find that the region labeled T in Fig.consists of fourfold symmetric twins whose orientation relationships are the following:
◇ (111) twins: (221)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [1¯10]CoSi2‖[1¯10]Si,
◆ (11¯1) twins: (22¯1)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [110]CoSi2‖[110]Si,
◻ (1¯1¯1) twins: (22¯1)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [110]CoSi2‖[110]Si,
∎ (1¯11) twins: (2¯21)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [110]CoSi2‖[110]Si.
CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that RDE CoSi2 layers grown on Si(001) by reactive deposition epitaxy using ultrahigh-vacuum magnetron sputtering in pure Ar discharges exhibit a cube-on-cube epitaxial relationship with the substrate, (001)CoSi2‖(001)Si and [100]CoSi2[100]Si, and a relaxed lattice constant ao=5.363Å. CoSi2 layers, ≃400Å, formed at 600°C are in a weak state of tension (ε‖=−0.37%) and partially relaxed (R=29%). In contrast, solid phase growth results in the formation of polycrystalline CoSi2 layers with average grain sizes of ≃100±50nm and a mixed 111∕002∕022∕112 orientation.
We attribute the striking difference in the microstructures of RDE and SPG CoSi2 to rapid Co diffusion into the Si substrate during RDE for which the high Co∕Si reactivity gives rise to a Co-flux-limited reaction resulting in the direct formation of the Si-rich disilicide phase. In contrast, sequential nucleation and transformation among increasingly Si-rich phases during SPG give rise to CoSi2 layers with polycrystalline texture.
A combination of XRD pole-figure and HR-XTEM analyses reveals the existence of fourfold symmetric twinned regions, with {221}CoSi2‖(001)Si and ⟨110⟩CoSi2‖[110]Si, in the epitaxial RDE CoSi2 layers. The twin planes and shear directions, based on detailed HR-XTEM analyses, are {111} and ⟨1¯12⟩, respectively. {111} facetted CoSi2∕Si(001) interface segments are also observed.
